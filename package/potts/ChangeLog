0.2-1  Fixed bug where pp and psum were int instead of double in potts.c

0.3    Changed niter argument to three: nbatch, blen, nspac
       Now works just like metrop in the mcmc package

0.3-1  Fixed bug where |A| in |A| * theta_color was incorrect (cc instead of gg)
          Bad bug.  Simulations all wrong before.
